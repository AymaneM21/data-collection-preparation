The Art Of Stacking Pre-Workouts: A Beginner's Guide,"by Brandon Verde – July 03, 2024",No description found,https://mjfitness.au/blogs/supplements/the-art-of-stacking-pre-workouts-a-beginners-guide,General Content,"Stacking pre-workouts means combining different types of pre-workout supplements, usually stimulant-based and stimulant-free, to maximise their benefits. This guide will help you understand how to tailor your pre-workouts to fit your needs, whether you're training early or late, need more or less energy, or want to boost muscle pumps, power, endurance, and focus."
,,,,Types of Pre-Workouts,Stimulant-Based Pre-Workouts: These are what most people think of when they think of pre-workouts. They contain caffeine and other stimulants to boost energy and alertness.
,,,,Types of Pre-Workouts,"Stimulant-Free Pre-Workouts: These don't contain caffeine but still enhance muscle pumps, endurance, power, and focus. They're great for late workouts or when you want to avoid stimulants."
,,,,Types of Pre-Workouts,"Fat Burners: These are designed to increase metabolism and promote fat loss with ingredients like green tea extract, capsaicin, and L-carnitine."
,,,,Why Stack?,"Every day is different, and so are your needs. Sometimes you need more energy, sometimes less. Stacking allows you to customise your pre-workout to match your daily requirements."
,,,,Why You Would Consider Stacking Your Pre-Workouts:,"Training Different Muscle Groups: You might want more pump for arms, shoulders, and chest, and less for back and legs where range of motion is important."
,,,,Why You Would Consider Stacking Your Pre-Workouts:,Training Later Than Usual: Using stim-free options can prevent disrupting your sleep cycle.
,,,,Why You Would Consider Stacking Your Pre-Workouts:,Cutting Down on Stims: You can reduce stimulant intake without cutting them out completely.
,,,,Why You Would Consider Stacking Your Pre-Workouts:,"Slept Less: On days when you have less energy, you might need more stimulants."
,,,,Cheat Sheet For Key Ingredients,Muscle Pumps: 4-6 grams of citrulline
,,,,Cheat Sheet For Key Ingredients,Endurance: 3.2 grams of beta-alanine or 2 grams of taurine
,,,,Cheat Sheet For Key Ingredients,Power: 1 gram of betaine
,,,,Cheat Sheet For Key Ingredients,Focus: 600mg of Alpha GPC
,,,,Step-By-Step Guide On Stacking,"Identify your primary goals: energy and focus, power and endurance, muscle pumps, or fat loss."
,,,,Step-By-Step Guide On Stacking,"""But I can just take half a scoop of my normal stimulant pre-workout, right?"" Well... yes. If energy is the only thing you care about. But by doing this, you're also cutting the doses of all the other effects like pumps, power, endurance, and focus."
,,,,Step-By-Step Guide On Stacking,Consume your pre-workout stack 20-30 minutes before exercise for optimal absorption.
,,,,Step-By-Step Guide On Stacking,"Pay attention to your body's response. Adjust dosages as needed. More stimulants for energy, or more of other ingredients for pumps, power, and endurance."
,,,,Conclusion,"Stacking pre-workouts can optimise your training and fat loss efforts when done correctly. Understand your goals, select the right supplements, and manage dosages carefully to enhance your performance safely."

Is Ozempic Worth The Hype? Exploring Natural Alternatives For Weight Loss,"by Brandon Verde – June 13, 2024",No description found,https://mjfitness.au/blogs/supplements/is-ozempic-worth-the-hype-exploring-natural-alternatives-for-weight-loss,General Content,"Ozempic is celebrated for its effectiveness in weight loss, but it comes with a range of side effects and unknown long-term impacts. If you're seeking safer, natural ways to manage your appetite and achieve your weight loss goals, consider these alternatives:"
,,,,Coffee: The Natural Appetite Suppressant,"Caffeine, found in coffee, is a well-known appetite suppressant. It works by stimulating the central nervous system, which can help reduce hunger and boost metabolism. A cup of black coffee before meals can help you feel full and eat less, contributing to weight loss."
,,,,Green Vegetables: Packed With Fibre,"Fibre is essential for feeling full, and green vegetables are a great source. Foods like broccoli, spinach, and kale are not only low in calories but also high in fibre, which slows down digestion and prolongs the feeling of fullness. Incorporating more greens into your diet can naturally curb your appetite and reduce overall calorie intake."
,,,,Water: The Ultimate Hydration Hack,"Drinking water between meals is a simple yet effective way to manage hunger. Staying hydrated helps keep your stomach full, reducing the likelihood of overeating. Aim to drink a glass of water before each meal to help control your appetite and promote weight loss."
,,,,Fat Burners: Targeted Ingredients For Appetite Suppression,"Certain ingredients in fat burners can help suppress appetite. Look for supplements containing Green Tea Extract, Garcinia Cambogia, Yerba Mate, and Caffeine. These natural compounds can help manage hunger and support your weight loss efforts."
,,,,Berberine: Nature’s Blood Sugar Regulator,"Berberine, a compound found in plants like barberry and goldenseal, is another natural alternative. Similar to Ozempic, berberine helps decrease blood sugar levels, which can lead to weight reduction. However, it doesn’t suppress hunger or slow stomach emptying like Ozempic does. Berberine is taken orally and offers a gentler approach to managing weight."
,,,,Berberine: Nature’s Blood Sugar Regulator,"While Ozempic offers rapid results, the potential side effects and long-term risks might make natural alternatives more appealing. These options can help you achieve your weight loss goals without compromising your health."
Top Supplements For Cycling,"by Brandon Verde – June 05, 2024",No description found,https://mjfitness.au/blogs/supplements/top-supplements-for-cyclists,General Content,"Maximise your rides and speed up recovery with these must-have supplements. Whether you’re a weekend warrior or a serious cyclist, the right supplementation can make all the difference."
,,,,Pre-Workout Essentials,"Before you hit the road, it’s crucial to fuel up properly. A pre-workout supplement with beta alanine, citrulline, and caffeine can give you the boost you need. Beta alanine helps your muscles endure longer rides, citrulline increases blood flow and delivers essential nutrients to your working muscles, and caffeine enhances focus and stamina. This trio sets you up for a strong start and sustained energy throughout your ride."
,,,,Intra-Ride Fuel,"Staying energised during your ride is just as important as your pre-ride prep. Simple carbohydrates and electrolytes are key here. Simple carbs, like those found in carb powders, provide quick energy to keep your glucose levels up. Electrolytes replace the minerals you lose through sweat, preventing cramps and fatigue. Mix carb powder into your water bottle for steady energy, and keep energy gels handy for a quick boost on the go."
,,,,Post-Ride Recovery,"After a long or intense ride, your muscles need help to recover. A good whey protein blend is essential for this. Protein aids in repairing and rebuilding muscle tissue, ensuring your legs are ready for the next ride. Consuming protein soon after your ride can significantly speed up recovery time, reducing soreness and fatigue."
,,,,"Fuel Up, Power On","Using the right supplements can make a big difference in your cycling performance. Pre-workout supplements prepare you for the ride, intra-ride fuels keep you going strong, and post-ride recovery aids help you bounce back faster. By incorporating these into your routine, you’ll not only improve your performance but also enjoy your rides more."
Ozempic: A New Tool In The Fight Against Obesity,"by Brandon Verde – May 28, 2024",No description found,https://mjfitness.au/blogs/supplements/what-is-ozempic,General Content,"In the fight against obesity, new medications are making a big difference. Enter, Ozempic. Originally created to help people with type 2 diabetes, Ozempic is now being recognised for its ability to aid in weight loss. Let's take a closer look at how Ozempic works and why it might be a game-changer for weight loss."
,,,,What Is Ozempic?,"Ozempic contains an active ingredient called semaglutide. It belongs to a group of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. These drugs mimic a natural hormone in the body called GLP-1, which helps control blood sugar levels, insulin release, and feelings of hunger and fullness."
,,,,Ozempic & Weight Loss,"During clinical trials, people taking Ozempic for diabetes also lost weight. This unexpected result led researchers to study Ozempic specifically for weight loss. The results were impressive: many people lost a significant amount of weight, sometimes more than 15% of their body weight."
,,,,Ozempic & Weight Loss,These effects combined make it easier to reduce calorie intake and lose weight.
,,,,Potential Side Effects,"Like any medication, Ozempic can cause side effects. Most are mild to moderate and tend to lessen over time. Common side effects include:"
,,,,Potential Side Effects,"In rare cases, more serious side effects can occur, such as:"
,,,,Potential Side Effects,It's crucial to talk to your healthcare provider about these potential risks.
,,,,Who Should Avoid Ozempic?,Ozempic isn't suitable for everyone. We recommend other weight loss alternatives. You should not use it if you:
,,,,Who Should Avoid Ozempic?,Always discuss your medical history and current medications with your healthcare provider before starting Ozempic.
,,,,Conclusion,"Ozempic offers a new option for those struggling with obesity. Its ability to significantly reduce weight and improve overall health makes it a valuable tool. However, there are much safer methods to dropping excess body fat. It's important to weigh the benefits against the risks and side effects and work closely with a healthcare professional to ensure it's the right choice for you."
Myo-Reps,"by Brandon Verde – January 12, 2024",No description found,https://mjfitness.au/blogs/workouts/myo-reps,General Content,"Myo-Reps are a specific rest-pause training technique that involves taking a working set to the point of failure to ensure maximum muscle fibre activation, and then maintaining this muscle fibre activation over a sustained period of time by utilising short rest breaks and multiple short sets."
,,,,Overview,"Myo-Reps are a specific rest-pause training technique that involves taking a working set to the point of failure to ensure maximum muscle fibre activation, and then maintaining this muscle fibre activation over a sustained period of time by utilising short rest breaks and multiple short sets."
,,,,How To Perform,"To perform Myo-Reps, begin with performing an ‘activation’ set to failure within the 10-12 rep range. Rack the weight and take 4-5 deep breaths over no more than 15 seconds, then begin the first Myo-Rep set of 6-8 reps to failure. Rack the weight again resting another 4-5 breaths over no more than 15 seconds, then perform another Myo-Rep set of 4-6 reps to failure. Continue with this short “rest to work” ratio until you can no longer perform a single rep with good form."
,,,,Capped Myo-Rep Sets,Myo-Reps can be performed using a capped number of total Myo-Reps performed for an exercise. For example capping a set at 20 total Myo-Reps would look like this;
,,,,Capped Myo-Rep Sets,"Perform an ‘activation’ set of 10-12 reps (+20 reps), with the (+20 reps) made up of Myo-Rep sets which can be broken down into any rep and set combination depending how heavy the weight is."
,,,,Capped Myo-Rep Sets,For example:
,,,,Capped Myo-Rep Sets,(5+5+5+5) = 20 Total Myo-Reps
,,,,Capped Myo-Rep Sets,(6+4+4+4+2) = 20 Total Myo-Reps
,,,,Capped Myo-Rep Sets,(8+5+4+3) = 20 Total Myo-Reps
,,,,Auto-Regulated Myo-Reps,Another variation of Myo-Reps that is best used over 6-8 week training blocks to help manage fatigue and recovery are known as “Auto-Regulated” Myo-Reps.
,,,,Auto-Regulated Myo-Reps,"By prescribing a set number of Myo-Reps to perform after each 10-15 second rest period, and stopping the exercise once that number is not reached, the training volume for any particular day is auto-regulated based on recovery and energy levels. For example, using the rule of 4 Myo-Reps following each rest period would look something like this;"
,,,,Auto-Regulated Myo-Reps,"Perform an ‘activation’ set of 8-10 reps, rest 5 breaths over no more than 15 seconds, then get 4 Myo-Reps. Rest another 5 breaths over no more than 15 seconds, then get another 4 Myo-Reps. Continue this pattern until only get 3 Myo-Reps are achieved on a set and then stop."
,,,,Auto-Regulated Myo-Reps,This “Auto-Regulation” will differ depending on energy and recovery on any given day as follows
,,,,Auto-Regulated Myo-Reps,Week 1 Chest: (Good Energy/Recovery)
,,,,Auto-Regulated Myo-Reps,Set 1: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 repsMyo-Reps: 1 2 3 4Myo-Reps: 1 2 3 4Myo-Reps: 1 2 3 4Myo-Reps: 1 2 3 4
,,,,Auto-Regulated Myo-Reps,"Overview: Total of 26 reps performed in 2 minutes, 16 effective Myo-Reps"
,,,,Auto-Regulated Myo-Reps,Week 4 Chest: (Poor Energy/Recovery)
,,,,Auto-Regulated Myo-Reps,Set 1: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 repsMyo-Reps: 1 2 3 4Myo-Reps: 1 2 3
,,,,Auto-Regulated Myo-Reps,"Overview: Total of 17 reps performed in 1-2 minutes, 7 effective Myo-Reps"
,,,,Workout Programming,Myo-Reps extend the efficiency of conventional sets and can therefore be applied to any exercise selection. They also require no change of equipment or weight making them highly suitable for athletes who prefer not to rely on training partners.
,,,,Workout Programming,"The added volume of Myo-Reps make them extremely effective during 4-8 week hypertrophy cycles, particularly for lagging muscle groups that require additional volume to spurt new muscle growth."
,,,,Workout Programming,"However, Myo-Reps can severely stress the central nervous systems (CNS), impede recovery, and increase DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness). They are therefore not optimal for power athletes or bodybuilders focused on increasing pure strength."
,,,,Advantages,Muscle tissue is very efficient at producing the force required for resistance training and will essentially recruit smaller fibres first and save the most powerful muscle fibres (those with the greatest growth potential) until they are absolutely needed – usually towards the end of a conventional set.
,,,,Advantages,"With conventional sets of 8-12 reps, activation of these larger muscle fibres will only occur on the last 2-3 reps. This activation begins to decline immediately following a conventional set with a typical rest period of 2-5 minutes, with the smaller fibres taking over once again at the beginning of the next set."
,,,,Advantages,Using Myo-Reps immediately following the ‘activation’ set does not allow the smaller fibres to recover and is an effective way to sustain full activation of the powerful muscle fibres that have the greatest potential for hypertrophic growth for a longer period of time.
,,,,Advantages,Myo-Reps are therefore highly effective at increasing the muscle growth gains (hypertrophy) that athletes seek without spending nearly as much time and energy as compared to traditional straight sets.
,,,,Advantages,Comparing Conventional Straight Sets to Myo-Rep Sets clearly highlights this advantage:
,,,,Advantages,Conventional Sets
,,,,Advantages,Set 1: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 (rest 2-3 minutes)
,,,,Advantages,Set 2: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 (rest 2-3 minutes)
,,,,Advantages,Set 3: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
,,,,Advantages,"Overview: Total of 29 reps performed in 7 minutes, with only 9 reps effectively activating the largest muscle fibres"
,,,,Advantages,Myo-Rep Set
