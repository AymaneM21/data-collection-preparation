# Upper Body Workout for Beginners and 12 Essential Exercises

  * [ Written by Guillem Ros  ](https://www.hevyapp.com/author/guillemros/)

The beauty of an upper body workout for beginners is that it ‘bundles’
different muscle groups and teaches them how to work together. For instance,
the bench press is primarily known as a chest-builder. But the exercise also
activates your **triceps, shoulders, and abs**
([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5504579/)).

The upper body includes all of the muscles above the waist – **the abs,
obliques, pectorals, shoulders, neck, trapezius, upper and lower back, biceps,
triceps, and forearms.**

Strengthening all of these muscles is important because they make you fitter,
more athletic, and better able to contribute to life. You also become more
independent and better able to tackle everyday tasks like doing manual labor,
moving furniture, and carrying groceries.

It is often the case that you want to track training and visualize your
improving fitness over time. **That’s why we
created[Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/), to enable athletes like you to have a
simple tool to log workouts and track your progress!**

The most apparent benefit of upper body training is that you get stronger,
which has many applications from sports to daily life and more. **Stronger
muscles also help keep you balanced and protect your spine, prevent injuries,
and keep you safe in training and life
situations**([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4395677/)).

Developing your [back](https://www.hevyapp.com/dumbbell-back-workout/) muscles
also helps them work better in maintaining good posture, which makes you look
better and can help prevent various aches and injuries down the road

developed pectorals.

![man incline bench press dumbbell upper body workout for

  5. Push through your elbows to lift your body as you exhale.

## 2 Beginner Upper Body Workouts

The premise behind any good upper body workout is to combine the right
exercises and train the right muscle groups together. **First,** it’s
beneficial to combine muscle groups that work well together.

**Examples include:**

– Biceps with back  
– Triceps with chest  
– Chest with shoulders  

You can also have fantastic [upper body
workouts](https://www.hevyapp.com/upper-lower-split-complete-guide/) that
train all of the major muscle groups together. But, if your goal is to have
somewhat shorter workouts, you should adhere to the above combinations.

**Second,** it’s important to structure each workout effectively for optimal
performance and the best possible stimulus. Start your workouts with
**compound movements** and gradually move down to **accessory lifts** and
**isolation exercises**.

### 1\. Upper Body Workout for Beginners (All Upper Body)

**[Bench Press (Barbell)](https://www.hevyapp.com/exercises/how-to-bench-
press-barbell/)**|  3 sets of 8 to 12 reps

## Beginner Workout Plans Containing Upper Body Workouts

### Upper Lower Plan

The [upper lower split](https://www.hevyapp.com/upper-lower-split-complete-
guide/) is among the most popular ways to organize your training. A common way
to program it is to have four weekly workouts – two upper and two lower.  

**Monday** – Upper  
**Tuesday** – Lower  
**Wednesday** – Off  
**Thursday** – Upper  
**Friday** – Lower  
**Saturday & Sunday** – Off

![upper lower split upper body workout for
beginners](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![upper
lower split upper body workout for beginners](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-
content/uploads/Upper_lower-upper-body-workout--1024x928.png) ![Upper lower
split upper body workout for
beginners](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Upper
lower split upper body workout for beginners](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-
content/uploads/Upper-lower-2-upper-body-workout--1024x993.png)

With this schedule, you have two upper-body workouts each week. The **goal is
to train all major muscle groups twice per week,** which appears optimal for
**hypertrophy**([7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27102172/)). If you
download [Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/), you’ll see some pre-built [Upper /
Lower workouts](https://www.hevyapp.com/upper-lower-split-complete-guide/)****
you can use for free.

As far as workout structure goes, you should typically start one of your upper
workouts with a **pushing** movement (such as a **flat or overhead press**)
and the other with a **pull** (such as a**pull-up or barbell row**).
**Alternate between exercises for your chest and back** and introduce
assistance and **isolation movements** for your shoulders, biceps, triceps,
abs, and lower back as your workout progresses.

A [workout plan ](https://www.hevyapp.com/workout-plans-for-every-fitness-
level/)like [Push Pull Legs (PPL)](https://www.hevyapp.com/push-pull-legs-
ultimate-guide/)**** will also segment your upper body training in an
efficient way.

### 3 Day Split (Like Bro Split)

[Three-day splits](https://www.hevyapp.com/3-day-split-workout-complete-
guide/) are similar to the classic [bro split](https://www.hevyapp.com/bro-
split-workout-program-guide/). The goal is to spread your training volume
across three unique workouts, which is beneficial for giving your muscles
enough time to recover. Plus, this type of training program is suitable if
you’re pressed for time and can’t dedicate more than three days each week to
working out.

**Day 1** – Chest, shoulders, and triceps (Upper body)  
**Day 2** – Back and biceps  
**Day 3** – Legs and abs

![3 day split \(bro split\) upper body workout for
beginners](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![3
day split \(bro split\) upper body workout for
beginners](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-content/uploads/3-day-split_-upper-body-
workout--1024x657.png)

The good thing about this split is that you get to train all of the major
muscle groups in your body. It’s also good for preventing too much overlapping
volume where you use a muscle group in one workout and then have to train it
the very next day.

Inside this structure, you split your upper body training into **two workouts:
one focuses on pushing movements and one on pulling.** The workout structure
is similar to the one you would have for any other split. You start your
workouts with **compound movements like the bench press and pull-up** and
gradually move to **assistance and isolation movements like chest flyes, bicep
curls, and lateral raises.**

## Benefits of Having a Strong Upper Body

### 1\. It Makes You Capable and Independent

The most notable benefit of upper body strength is that you’re more capable of
doing everyday activities without needing assistance. Things like carrying
groceries, moving furniture, and lifting your child all become easier. This is
also fantastic because you get to be more independent and don’t have to rely
on others’ help for somewhat challenging activities.

**Plus, research finds a positive correlation between physical strength and
quality of life in elderly individuals
([5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2443114/)).**

### 2\. It Improves Your Posture And Keeps Nagging Aches at Bay

![bicep curl upper body workout for
beginners](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![bicep
curl upper body workout for beginners](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-
content/uploads/pexels-julia-larson-6455960.jpg)

Poor posture can stem from many things, and we sometimes need a professional’s
assistance to resolve such an issue. But, in many cases, healthy individuals
suffer from poor posture precisely because of weak and tight muscles.
Specifically, tight muscles in the **front (chest and shoulders)** and weak
muscles in the **[back](https://www.hevyapp.com/dumbbell-back-workout/)(lats,
rhomboids, trapezius, etc.**) ([3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7967758/),[
4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5889545/)). There are many
exercises that you can do to keep your back muscles strong.

Developing upper body strength is great for your posture precisely because it
addresses the issue of the back musculature. **Strengthening these muscles
will keep your spine in a natural position and prevent your shoulders from
rolling forward.**

### 3\. It Simply Feels Good

Whether we like to admit it or not, we train to feel better about ourselves,
and there is nothing wrong with that. Having a stronger upper body, reaching
new goals, and setting personal records are all rewarding things. With
[Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/), you can easily see when you set personal
records and improve over time. With each passing workout, you feel better
knowing that you’re more capable.

Plus, this can be incredibly valuable if you’re a competitive person and enjoy
doing better than your friends; compare exercises on
[Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/)!

## Conclusion

[Upper body workouts](https://www.hevyapp.com/upper-body-workout-exercises/)
are those that bundle several muscle groups and have you train them together.
These can **include your core, chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps,
forearms, and traps.**

Upper body training is essential because it contributes to your overall
fitness, helps you become more athletic, and allows you to do more and remain
independent.

As far as workout structure goes, putting together effective workouts is not a
big deal. All you have to do is follow some basic rules, be mindful of the
overall layout, and learn how to sequence exercises. As you saw above, you
have two fantastic ways to organize upper body workouts for beginners into a
training week.

**First,** you can use an upper lower plan to train your upper body anywhere
from one to three times per week. **Second,** you can go for the simpler
three-day routine that splits your upper body musculature into two workouts.

As always, thanks for reading! If you need any help with tracking your
workouts, using an app like [Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/) can help to
structure them and visualize progress.

## FAQ

### _1) What is a good upper body workout?_

A good upper body workout allows you to train a large percentage of your upper
body musculature, gets you to do enough training volume, and includes various
movements for the target muscle groups
([8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6934277/),[
9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6303131/)).

### _2) How can I work out my upper body at home?_

Training your upper body at home is not as difficult as many people imagine.
Movements like pull-ups and chin-ups, push-ups, chair dips, planks,
handstands, crunches, pike push-ups, and burpees are all excellent ways to
train the majority of your upper body musculature
([10](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29466268/)).

### _3) How long should my workouts be?_

The goal of your training shouldn’t be to set a timer and try to fit within a
given time frame. Instead, you should do all of your sets and repetitions, go
down your list of exercises, and rest well between sets
([11](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19691365/),[
12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26605807/)). No single workout should be
much longer than an hour for the average person, especially if they train more
often.

### _4) How long should I rest between upper body workouts?_

Research finds that muscle protein synthesis tends to drop within around 36 to
48 hours of training, and this is a guideline to follow when organizing your
upper body training ([13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8563679/)). Of
course, this can vary based on the length and difficulty of your workouts,
your fitness level, your schedule, and goals. For most people, two upper body
workouts per week will be the sweet spot. Rest a couple of days between the
two, and you’ll do great.
