# 5×5 Workout Program – The Ultimate Guide (2024)

  * [ Written by Guillem Ros  ](https://www.hevyapp.com/author/guillemros/)

## What is the 5×5 Workout Program?

The 5×5 workout program is perhaps the simplest and most straightforward
approach to building muscle and strength. With the classic version of this
program, you get to perform five barbell movements: the squat, deadlift,
[bench press](https://www.hevyapp.com/exercises/how-to-bench-press-barbell/),
overhead press, and bent-over row. The exercises get divided into two unique
workouts A and B.

**5×5 A**

Squat – 5 sets x 5 reps  
Bench – 5 sets x 5 reps  
Bent-Over Row – 5 sets x 5 reps

**5×5 B**

Squat – 5 sets x 5 reps  
Overhead Press – 5 sets x 5 reps  
Deadlift – 5 sets x 5 reps  

These workouts are usually alternated in each workout session, so if you work
out 3 times per week, your weekly schedules would look something like the
following.

**Week 1**  
Monday – Workout A  
Tuesday – Off  
Wednesday – Workout B  
Thursday – Off  
Friday – Workout A  
Saturday & Sunday – Off

**Week 2**  
Monday – Workout B  
Tuesday – Off  
Wednesday – Workout A  
Thursday – Off  
Friday – Workout B  
Saturday & Sunday – Off

The principle behind this type of training is as simple as it gets: Perform
five sets with your working weight of five reps of each exercise. That means,
first do some warm up sets making your way up to your working weight, and then
throughout the 5 sets, do 5 reps at that working weight. If you complete your
sets without experiencing a breakdown in technique, add 5 lbs/2.5 kg the next
time you workout. For example, if you squat 225 lbs for five sets of five on
Monday, start with 230 lbs on Wednesday.

Something that will help you keep track of your reps and sets is logging your
workouts in a tracker like [Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/). It will tell you
how much you lifted last time, and will give you analytics to [track your
progress](https://www.hevyapp.com/) over time.

Of course, as with any type of progression, it’s essential to remain objective
with your performance. Before adding more weight to the bar, make sure you’re
lifting the current weight with good form. If you’re struggling to maintain
proper technique or have to reach failure on every set, it’s best to continue
with the current weight for a while before attempting to lift more
([1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26666744/)).

16 Frequently Asked Questions

Also, keep in mind that this program is relatively demanding. Every workout
has Squats, so assuming you workout 3 times per week, you will be squatting
three times per week! It’s best to start with a lighter weight – somewhere
around 50 percent of your 1 RM and slowly work it up over the weeks.

## The 5×5 Workout Plan

Now that we have some idea what the 5×5 program entails, let’s design a plan.
This program will have two unique workouts (A and B), you will train three
days per week, and you will alternate between the two workouts. Meaning, you
will complete one cycle every two weeks.

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-
content/uploads/5x5-horizontal-3-1024x489.png)

Here is how it would look:

**Week 1**  
Monday – Workout A  
Tuesday – Off  
Wednesday – Workout B  
Thursday – Off  
Friday – Workout A  
Saturday & Sunday – Off

**Week 2**  
Monday – Workout B  
Tuesday – Off  
Wednesday – Workout A  
Thursday – Off  
Friday – Workout B  
Saturday & Sunday – Off

Here are the two workouts:

**Workout A**  
Back Squat – 5 sets x 5 reps  
Barbell Bench Press – 5 sets x 5 reps  
Bent Over Row – 5 sets x 5 reps

**Workout B**  
Back Squat – 5 sets x 5 reps  
Barbell Overhead Press – 5 sets x 5 reps  
Deadlift – 5 sets x 5 reps

## Picking Your Working Weights

As you’re just getting started with the 5×5 workout program, you should
definitely ease into it. Depending on how you’ve been training so far, easing
into this can vary in length and magnitude. In general, we recommend starting
more conservatively and building from there.

![deadlift woman

woman hat](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-content/uploads/anastase-maragos-
aclkvEMIfL8-unsplash.jpg)

For example, if you have a good idea of your 1RM on the core lifts, start with
around 50% of your 1RM. For instance, if your best bench press is 230 lbs,
start your working sets with approximately 115 lbs. This achieves two things:

First, it helps you get accustomed to the program and frequency. Second, it
allows you to gain momentum and get a good feel for progression. Instead of
plateauing after a couple of weeks because your starting weights were too
heavy, you get to increase the weight over several weeks steadily. This is
great for motivation and morale.

Check out [our PR workouts article](https://www.hevyapp.com/pr-meaning-
workout/) to learn more about testing your 1RM, when you should do it, and how
to select the appropriate weight.

## Warming Up Properly

Besides the mandatory warm-up routine you would do before every workout, we
recommend doing some basic warm-up sets for each exercise. In general, it’s
best to start with an empty barbell and make modest increases in weight until
you reach your working weight. Warming up properly will help boost longevity
and allow you to train more effectively
([5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19996770/)) long term.

## Rest Between Sets

The primary objective of resting between sets is to allow your muscles to rest
temporarily to gather enough strength to do your repetitions as designed in
the workout. This will depend on the individual, but general recommendations
suggest resting anywhere from two to five minutes between sets with heavier
weights.

![man sitting recovery green
bottle](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![man
sitting recovery green bottle](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-
content/uploads/anastase-maragos-HyvE5SiKMUs-unsplash-2.jpg)

When in doubt, rest a bit more rather than less. This is linked to superior
muscle gain over time and allows you to perform better on each set
([6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26605807/)).

## Progression With 5×5 Workout

The 5×5 program is simple to understand and follow. Of course, this doesn’t
make it _easy_. As we discussed above, this program employs a linear
progression model. Meaning, you use the same structure in each workout and
only increase the weight when you get, that’s right, _five_ _reps_ across
_five_ _sets_.

For instance, if you start bench pressing with 135 pounds and you get 5, 5, 5,
5, and _4_ , you stick to that weight until you cover the progression
requirements. In contrast, if you get your five reps on all sets and even do
more on some sets, then you have a green light to move up.

In general, adding 2.5kg (5lbs) to the bar is a good idea. For example, if you
get five reps across five sets on the bench press with 135 pounds, train with
140 pounds next time.

Most folks recommend adding 5kg (10lbs) on the deadlift, but you should always
use your best judgment when adding more weight. For example, if you get 5×5
with 300 pounds, you can try 310 pounds the next time. If that feels too
heavy, there is no shame in adding only 5 pounds and going for 5×5 with 305.

![weights dumbbells
gym](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![weights
dumbbells gym](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-content/uploads/weights-
dumbbells.jpg)

As far as the overhead press and bent over row, you can make even smaller
increases of around 1kg (2lbs). The reason is, progress happens more slowly on
these exercises, and adding too much weight can quickly ruin your technique.
It’s better to take it slow and progress linearly for longer.

Okay, but how good is this way of progress? Well, research certainly supports
it. In one recent study, researchers found that linear periodization allowed
older adults with sarcopenia (muscle atrophy) to build more strength and
muscle ([13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6416506/)). They
also had to do less work to achieve this effect.

A systematic review and meta-analysis compared linear periodization to DUP and
found them similar for muscle hypertrophy
([14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5571788/)).

With consistency and hard work, linear programming can be a simple and
fantastic way for folks to get stronger and build muscle.

## The Three Most Significant Benefits of the 5×5 Workout Program

### 1\. It Offers An Optimal Training Frequency

According to research, training our muscles twice per week is superior for
hypertrophy than once ([3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27102172/)).
Despite its moderate training volume, the 5×5 program offers an optimal
frequency, which is great for those who also want to build muscle besides
strength.

Although the classic program has you do just five exercises, each of them
trains a range of muscle groups. Together, they provide an adequate stimulus
to the major muscle groups in your body and offer a simple approach to
building muscle. Plus, because each movement is done with a barbell, the
overloading potential is fantastic, and you get to impose significant
mechanical tension, which is a crucial factor for muscle hypertrophy
([4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20847704/)).

Other workout programs that also offer great training frequency are the [Push
Pull Legs (PPL) plan](https://www.hevyapp.com/push-pull-legs-ultimate-guide/),
or an [Upper Lower Plan](https://www.hevyapp.com/upper-lower-split-complete-
guide/).

### 2\. It Helps You Develop Neuromuscular Efficiency

Neuromuscular efficiency refers to your ability to recruit more muscle fibers
to produce force. Peak efficiency is specific to the tasks, but it also
benefits other activities. For example, the more you back squat, the better
you will recruit your muscles for that specific task. This isn’t to say that
back squatting can’t benefit your performance on other movements, such as the
front squat.

The 5×5 workout program is great for neuromuscular efficiency because it
allows you to work through specific movement patterns multiple times per week
([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6036131/)). For example, you
get to squat three times per week, which allows you to improve your ability to
recruit motor units for that specific movement pattern.

As a result, you can see steady improvements in squat performance without
necessarily gaining muscle mass.

### 3\. It’s Simple (And Has a Clear Objective)

Let’s face it, training programs come in all shapes and sizes, and some are
incredibly complicated. The beauty of the 5×5 workout program is that you have
clear training objectives and following the workouts is simple. Progressing is
also straightforward, and you rarely have to wonder about any aspect of your
training.

## The Main 5×5 Exercises

### Squat

The squat is one of the most natural and practical exercises you can do to
strengthen and develop your [lower body](https://www.hevyapp.com/leg-workouts-
and-lower-body-exercises/) musculature
([7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5435978/)). Specifically,
the squat emphasizes your quadriceps – the primary knee extensors. Besides
that, squats also train your posterior chain (hamstrings, glutes, back),
abdominal muscles, shoulders, and arms.

The primary muscle group in the squat is the quadriceps, but other muscle
groups work to keep the barbell’s position, help you maintain a rigid
structure, and stay balanced throughout each repetition.

In the context of the 5×5 program, the squat is vital because it works great
in combination with the other exercises (which we’ll look at next) and allows
you to achieve complete muscular development.

Speaking of that, we recommend that you go with front squats or high-bar back
squats for the 5×5 workout program
([8](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25630691/)). The reason is, both of these
exercises work well with a high training frequency, and your risks of
developing aches or overtraining yourself are much smaller.

In contrast, low-back back squats can lead to elbow and shoulder pain for some
individuals when performed too frequently.

As far as technique goes, make sure that each repetition is of high quality.
Squat as low as you comfortably can and make sure that your heels never lift
off the floor. As you’re ready to squat up, push through your heels.

### [Bench Press](https://www.hevyapp.com/exercises/how-to-bench-press-
barbell/)

The [bench press](https://www.hevyapp.com/exercises/how-to-bench-press-
barbell/) – a classic exercise and one that every gym bro & gal on the planet
does with religious dedication. It’s an exercise that lives up to its
reputation and delivers impressive benefits _when done correctly and
intelligently._

What’s the first question people ask when you tell them you lift weights?
That’s right: “How much do ya bench, bro?”

But what makes this exercise so valuable? Most notably, the [bench
press](https://www.hevyapp.com/exercises/how-to-bench-press-barbell/) is one
of the best chest-building activities out there
([9](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218209)).
It targets the chest muscles well, the overloading potential is fantastic, and
learning how to do it correctly doesn’t take a tremendous amount of time or
effort. Plus, its mobility requirements are low, and most average people can
get good at it. The chest is one of the most important muscle groups for women
and also one of the most neglected, we’ve written about this in another
article, [chest exercises for women](https://www.hevyapp.com/chest-exercises-
for-women/).

In the context of the 5×5 program, the [bench
press](https://www.hevyapp.com/exercises/how-to-bench-press-barbell/) is even
more valuable. It is your primary (and only) horizontal pressing exercise that
develops your chest, shoulders, and triceps. It helps complete the 5×5 workout
program in a way that optimizes your physical development and strength.

As a relatively simple exercise, many people jump to the bench press and load
the barbell up. It’s important to be mindful of a few crucial things:

  1. Learn how to use leg drive correctly. This will make a massive difference in your stability and power output.
  2. Keep your elbows relatively tucked in. Avoid flaring them out, as that puts your shoulders in a compromised position.
  3. Learn how to keep your shoulders back and down. Like the previous point, this will also help keep your shoulders in a safe, healthy, and strong position for pressing.

### Barbell Bent Over Row

The barbell row is another fantastic exercise and one that strengthens and
develops your entire back, shoulders, biceps, and grip strength. In general,
you can pick between two variations:

  1. The classic bent-over row where you bend forward and keep the barbell off the floor at all times.
  2. The Pendlay row where you bend forward a bit more and rest the barbell on the floor between repetitions.

Both variations work great, and it’s worth experimenting to see which one
works better for you. What matters most is that you feel the exercise well, it
doesn’t put any strain on your lower back, and it activates your back muscles
properly. So long as you cover these criteria, you can pick whichever version
you prefer.

In the context of the 5×5 program, the barbell row is one of two back-building
exercises. It works great for building your pulling muscles – lats, rhomboids,
trapezius, rear deltoids, and biceps. Thanks to that, it also benefits your
deadlift performance and allows you to make more predictable progress.

To do this exercise effectively, what matters most is that you perform each
repetition with a good range of motion and avoid momentum. Sure, adding speed
to the mix can help you train with heavier weights. But that often comes at
the expense of optimal muscle activation, which defeats the exercise’s whole
purpose.

In general, you won’t gain as much strength on the barbell row when compared
to other exercises, so it’s important to be mindful of your technique at all
times and realize that small improvements add up.

### Deadlift

Volumes have been written about this fantastic exercise. Similar to the squat,
deadlifts are a [whole-body](https://www.hevyapp.com/full-body-workout/)

exercise that helps strengthen and develop a range of muscle groups in the
body ([11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7046193/)). What’s
even more impressive about deadlifts, is that they improve intramuscular
coordination and have many sport-specific applications.

Your legs, glutes, hips, and back must work together to help you lift the
barbell off the floor and to the top position. Also, your abdominal muscles
contribute to spinal stability, your arms help keep the barbell on the right
track, and your hands work hard to grasp the weight.

Thanks to this, deadlifts allow us to train with heavier weights and make more
predictable strength progress. It’s not uncommon for serious trainees to
develop a deadlift in the 300, 400, and even 500-pound range over time.

In the context of the 5×5 program, the deadlift serves an essential purpose to
help train your posterior chain and improve leg strength. When done
consistently, it helps develop a wide range of muscle groups and improves your
performance on the other exercises, primarily the squat and barbell row.

What’s even better about the deadlift is that you can pick from different
variations, depending on your preferences and anatomy. For example, if you
find conventional deadlifts to be awkward, you can instead go for sumo
([12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11932579/)).

What matters most is that you always practice good technique. The deadlift can
improve us, but we need to respect it and do each repetition with good form.
Most notably, aim to keep your back in a neutral position. If your back tends
to round, the issue could relate to poor mobility, using too much weight, or
not bracing correctly.

### Overhead Press

Despite what some say, the overhead press is a [full-
body](https://www.hevyapp.com/full-body-workout/) compound exercise that
trains your shoulders and a range of other muscles
([13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23096062/)). Your shoulders, upper
chest, and triceps do most of the work, while your core musculature helps keep
you stable.

Because of its biomechanics, the overhead press develops your pushing
strength, improves your balance, and teaches you how to brace more
effectively.

Unlike some exercises where cheating helps folks lift heavier weight, the
overhead press is a humbling movement. To press heavy weights above your head,
you need to be strong, and there is no way around it. Sure, you can use some
leg drive and momentum to help yourself. But if you don’t have a solid
foundation, you won’t find yourself making good progress in the long run.

In the context of compound training, the overhead press is among the most
challenging movements because you can’t press that much weight, and progress
happens more slowly. This can feel a bit disheartening at times, but you need
to accept it as fact and give it everything you’ve got.

The overhead press is an excellent addition to the 5×5 workout program
precisely because it allows you to develop your pushing strength in a
different plane – vertically. Doing so benefits your bench press and helps
further develop your chest, shoulders, and triceps.

What matters most is that you perform each repetition with good form and a
full range of motion. Lift the barbell and lower it in a controlled fashion,
avoid using momentum, and avoid dropping the bar from the top position.

On a similar note, be more conservative with your loading and progression. Add
more weight to the barbell only when you’re confident that your technique is
excellent and you’re ready for a heavier load.

## Rest Days During the 5×5 Workout Plan

In general, the 5×5 program is quite flexible because you only have to train
three days per week. For instance, you can follow the classic outline of
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Alternatively, you can train on Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays. Both options will work equally well, and it mostly
depends on your preferences and availability.

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-
content/uploads/rest-day.jpg)

You should always leave at least a day of recovery in-between sessions to
prevent a drop in performance. If you do your workouts in a row, you’ll run
into issues. For example, your legs will be fatigued from squatting, and you
won’t be able to perform well the next day. Similarly, your shoulders, chest,
and triceps will also be tired.

Training is vital for causing a stimulus. But your recovery is what then
allows that stimulus to turn into an adaptation
([15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5401959/)). If you don’t
give yourself enough time to recover between workouts, the program won’t be
useful because you won’t perform at your best.

## Adapting the 5×5 Workout To Your Goals

Another great thing about the 5×5 program is that you can adapt it to your
goals. In other words, even if strength isn’t your single and most important
goal, you can take the principles of 5×5 and create yourself a more versatile
program.

For instance, you might want to include more assistance work for the
individual muscle groups in your body. In doing so, you’ll be able to do more
volume and hopefully cause greater hypertrophy
([16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6303131/)).

The bench, squat, deadlift, bent over row, and the overhead press will deliver
significant results. But adding assistance work can help you achieve even
better results, provided you recover well, and your nutrition is on point.

Here are some exercise ideas:

  * Biceps – chin-ups and various curls
  * Triceps – dips and extensions
  * Shoulders – lateral raises and face pulls
  * Abs – hanging knee raises and planks
  * Chest – flyes and push-ups
  * Back – lat pulldowns and dumbbell rows
  * Quads – leg press, leg extension, and lunges
  * Hamstrings and glutes – glute-ham raises, leg curls, and donkey kicks
  * Calves – calf raise variations

Here is how you might add some accessory and isolation work to the standard
5×5 workouts:

**5×5 Workout A – Accessory**

High-Bar Back Squat – 5 sets x 5 reps  
Flat Barbell Bench Press – 5 sets x 5 reps  
Bent-Over Row – 5 sets x 5 reps  
_Dumbbell bicep curls – 2 to 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps  
Cable rope tricep extensions – 2 to 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps  
Cable rope face pulls – 2 to 3 sets of 12 to 25 reps_

**5×5 Workout B – Accessory**

High-Bar Back Squat – 5 sets x 5 reps  
Standing Barbell Overhead Press – 5 sets x 5 reps  
Conventional Deadlift – 5 sets x 5 reps  
_Classic push-ups – 2 to 3 sets of 10 to 20 reps  
Unilateral dumbbell rows – 2 to 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps  
Leg extensions – 2 to 3 sets of 12 to 20 reps_  

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-
content/uploads/5x5-accessory-workout-A-B-1.png)

Alternatively, you might want to add some cardio to your strength training –
that’s also a great idea. It’s best to do cardio on your recovery days to
minimize the interference effect
([17](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24728927/)). It’s also better to go for
less impactful forms of cardio like cycling. For example:

Monday – Workout A  
Tuesday – 40 minutes of low-intensity cardio  
Wednesday – Workout B  
Thursday – 40 minutes of low-intensity cardio  
Friday – Workout A  
Saturday & Sunday – off

With all of that said, we do recommend easing into the 5×5 program, doing a
proper introduction (where you start with lighter weights initially), and
seeing how things go. Once you get used to the tempo of the 5×5 program, you
can look for ways to mold it to your specific style and goals.

The more exercises you include, the harder it will get to recover on time. So,
be mindful when making any adjustments to the original program and monitor how
they impact you.

## Who is the 5×5 Workout Program For?

You might be wondering, “Well, this 5×5 program seems good, but is it good for
me?” In general, the 5×5 workout program can work great for almost everyone.
Unless you’re recovering from injuries (in which case, always consult with
your doctor) or are quite advanced, the 5×5 program will produce good results.

> The program works great for beginners because it leads to rapid strength and
> muscle gains initially and helps them maximize their newbie phase. At the
> same time, the program isn’t that demanding to prevent beginners from
> gaining momentum. All you have to do is learn five exercises, have three
> weekly workouts, and follow a simple progression scheme.

With enough consistency and proper nutrition, this program can deliver steady
results for a long time.

Intermediate lifters can also achieve great results on 5×5 programming thanks
to the high training frequency. According to research, training our muscles
twice per week seems optimal for hypertrophy, but training three times a week
can also work great ([3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27102172/)). As far
as strength is concerned, performing the different lifts more often will lead
to quicker results
([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6036131/)).

Like many things, your lifting performance also depends on skill to some
degree. The more you work on an exercise, the better and more technically-
proficient you become.

## Popular 5×5 Workout Plans

### Stronglifts 5×5

Let’s summarize the Stronglifts 5×5 program:

  * You have five exercises – the bench press, squat, barbell row, overhead press, and deadlift.
  * You have two workouts to alternate between – Workout A and Workout B.
  * You have to train three times per week.
  * Make sure to always have at least a day of recovery in-between your training sessions – for example, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
  * The program follows a linear progression model – increase the weight once you do five sets of five reps with the current load.
  * Add more weight only when you’re confident that your technique is good and you control the weight well.
  * Add up to ten pounds on the deadlift, five pounds on the squat and bench, and as little as 2.5 pounds on the overhead press and row. The goal is _improvement_ , not technique sabotage.
  * It’s good to start with lighter weights at first – around 50 percent of your 1 RM. This will help you get used to the program and make linear improvements for longer.
  * Rest anywhere from two to five minutes between sets. The goal is to recover well so that you can do your prescribed repetitions across all sets. Rushing the workout will only sabotage your performance and slow down progression.

The Stronglifts 5×5 program, as outlined, is usually better for beginners.
Once a lifter becomes more advanced, they can run into some issues, which the
Madcow 5×5 program addresses. Let’s see.

### Madcow 5×5

One of the biggest differences between Stronglifts 5×5 and [Madcow
5×5](https://www.hevyapp.com/madcow-5x5/) is the program that with Stronglifts
5×5, you get to add weight each workout, however on Madcow 5×5, the goal is to
add weight each _week_.

Besides this significant difference, both programs share similar details. The
principle of progression, exercise selection, and workout structure are
similar. Training volume differs, you’re using varying loads, and you now have
some lighter work in the middle of your training week.

Specifically, you no longer do five sets of five reps across exercises but
instead ramp up the intensity and end up doing a single heavy set of five
reps. Your second squat workout of the week is also lighter. You’ll be
training with a bit less weight to give yourself enough time to recover from
the first heavy workout of the week. And, of course, you’ll only aim to add
weight to the bar every week instead of every workout.

But why is this the case? The issue is, we can’t make linear progress forever.
In other words, one tactic might have helped you boost your squat from 60 to
250 pounds. But you’ll need a significantly different approach to go from 250
to 350 pounds. And yet another method to go from 350 to 450.

Plus, as the weight gets heavier, recovery demands increase. Sure, you might
be able to squat 135 pounds for 5×5 on Monday, go back on Wednesday, and do
5×5 with 140 pounds. But you won’t be able to do the same with 250+ pounds.
Recovery is still the crucial element for positive adaptations, and
[Madcow](https://www.hevyapp.com/madcow-5x5/) simply emphasizes it.

## What Are The Pros And Cons of the 5×5 Workout?

### Pros

  * It’s straightforward to set up and get started. All you need to do is set up three simple workouts and pick starting weights.
  * You don’t have to dedicate yourself to a high training frequency and be at the gym five times per week.
  * You have a clear and straightforward progression scheme to follow – once you do five sets of five reps, move up the weight.
  * Your objectives are clear, and you don’t have to deal with complicated programming or load selection.
  * Improvements happen predictably for a long time. It’s not uncommon to squat, bench and deadlift well into the 200 pounds on this program.
  * Thanks to the high frequency, you get to develop sound technical proficiency for these core exercises.
  * The program is also suitable for hypertrophy because it offers plenty of training volume and a high training frequency for each muscle group.
  * You can add accessory work or cardio to make it fun and more varied.

### Cons

  * It takes some time to master the core barbell lifts – you need careful planning and execution to get better over time.
  * There is a risk of injury if you’re not careful. These barbell lifts are complex and small errors in technique can compound. Every repetition needs to be good.
  * While seemingly simple, the 5×5 program is not easy. You’re only doing barbell exercises, which are quite taxing, and you need to push yourself from workout to workout.
  * Workouts are long. Between warming up, doing warm-up sets, preparing the barbell, and resting enough between working sets, it’s not uncommon to train for well over an hour. This can be challenging if you don’t have as much time for working out.
  * It can be tedious to go through 5×5 workouts because you have to spend most of the time resting between sets.

## Comparison With Other Training Plans

### 5×5 vs. [3-Day Split](https://www.hevyapp.com/3-day-split-workout-
complete-guide/)

The [3-day split](https://www.hevyapp.com/3-day-split-workout-complete-guide/)
has always been popular among trainees because it works. Like the 5×5 program,
you only have to train three days per week, but each workout is challenging
and helps you achieve fantastic results. It’s a good starting point for
beginners because the high frequency helps improve lifting skills and
optimizes muscle gain.

The question is, which of the two is better? Both are in their unique ways.
For example, the 5×5 workout program is excellent because it shows you exactly
what you need to do. But it’s also more rigid, and there is little
flexibility.

### 5×5 vs. [Upper Lower](https://www.hevyapp.com/upper-lower-split-complete-
guide/)

The [upper lower split](https://www.hevyapp.com/upper-lower-split-complete-
guide/) is also popular among trainees because it offers an optimal training
frequency and allows for decent strength gains. The most common way to do the
upper lower split would be to have four weekly workouts – two upper and two
lower. You can also train three times per week and alternate between a lower
and [upper body workout](https://www.hevyapp.com/upper-body-workout-
exercises/) over the weeks.

Compared to the 5×5 program, an [upper lower
split](https://www.hevyapp.com/upper-lower-split-complete-guide/) is more of a
hybrid approach. The different thing about an Upper Lower Split, or a [Push
Pull Legs (PPL) program](https://www.hevyapp.com/push-pull-legs-ultimate-
guide/) is the division of muscle groups during each workout day.

### 5×5 vs. [Bro Split](https://www.hevyapp.com/bro-split-workout-program-
guide/)

The [bro split](https://www.hevyapp.com/bro-split-workout-program-guide/),
while not as popular as it once was, still has merit. It’s a highly flexible
approach to training that helps trainees make good strength and muscle
improvements. The goal is to dedicate specific days for training given muscle
groups – for example, chest on Monday, back on Wednesday, and legs on Friday.

The issue is, [bro splits](https://www.hevyapp.com/bro-split-workout-program-
guide/) typically work better with a higher frequency where you don’t have to
train more than one or two muscle groups in a workout. Three-day versions can
work, but your workouts will have to be much longer.

In terms of effectiveness, it can be beneficial for muscle gain. But the 5×5
workout program would be the better choice, given the many benefits and
fantastic strength improvements you can make.

## Conclusion

The 5×5 workout program is a tried-and-true method for getting stronger and
building some muscle in the process. Countless individuals have used this
simple training program and have made fantastic strength progress in a matter
of months.

The main points about the program are:

  * Start light and ramp up the intensity slowly
  * Train three days per week with at least a day in-between for recovery
  * Focus on great technique on every repetition
  * Once you get 5×5 with a particular load, increase the weight and start over
  * Rest enough between sets to maintain your performance on each set
  * Once 5×5 stops working as intended, move to Madcow 5×5

What’s even more impressive about 5×5 workout is the simplicity. This program
is evidence that simple programming can work for a long time. If you’re
looking to stay consistent over time, tracking your workouts with
[Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/) will help!

Too many people look for the most complicated approach, where something clear
and simple would work much better. All you have to do is select light enough
loads, remain consistent, do your five sets of five, and make small steps up.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**_1\. What is a 5×5 training plan?_**

The 5×5 training plan is a strength program designed to help you build whole-
body strength, athleticism, and muscle mass. It employs a linear model of
progression. Once you achieve 5×5 with a given weight, add a bit extra for
your next workout.

**_2\. When should I do cardio when doing a 5×5 plan?_**

Cardio is not mandatory for 5×5 success, and doing too much can interfere with
your strength adaptations ([17](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24728927/)).
Still, if you want to do some cardio for good health and improved recovery, it
would be best to do it on your rest days. If that’s not possible, do cardio
after your main lifting work.

**_3\. How many exercises per muscle group in a 5×5 workout?_**

There is quite a bit of overlap on a 5×5 program, which makes it efficient—for
instance, the squat and deadlift both train a large percentage of the body.
The overhead and bench press both train the chest, shoulders, and triceps. The
deadlift and row both train your arms, shoulders and back.  
  
We could make a case that all five movements train most muscle groups in the
body, at least to some degree.

**_4\. Why is the 5×5 workout plan superior?_**

The 5×5 plan is inherently superior to most training programs out there
because of its simplicity. It’s simple to set up and follow; you don’t need a
coach to tell when you should add more weight, and you don’t have to do
countless exercises.  
  
The goal is to master the fundamentals, apply them consistently, and push
yourself hard.

**_5\. How long should my workouts be?_**

The simple answer? Your workouts should be as long as needed for you to
complete all of your sets systematically. In other words, you need to rest
enough between sets to maintain your performance as the workout progresses.
The goal here is adequate recovery. Trying to rush through your training won’t
be good for your long-term development.

**_6\. Is a 5×5 a good routine for gym beginners?_**

Yes, the 5×5 program is fantastic for beginners because it helps them
establish a strong foundation and teaches them how to perform five of the most
important lifts in the gym.  
  
With that said, complete beginners should work with a coach, at least in the
beginning, and it’s always a benefit to [track your
workouts](https://www.hevyapp.com/). A good coach will teach them proper
technique, monitor their workout performance, motivate them, and give them
helpful tips and insights.
