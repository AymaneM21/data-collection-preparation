# The Upper / Lower Split – Complete Workout Program Guide

  * [ Written by Guillem Ros  ](https://www.hevyapp.com/author/guillemros/)

## **What Is The Upper/Lower Split?**

The upper/lower split is among the most popular ways to organize your
training. The idea behind it is very simple: You split your training into
[upper body exercise](https://www.hevyapp.com/upper-body-workout-exercises/)
days and lower body exercise days. The most common way is to spread your
weekly training volume across four workouts – two upper, and two lower. For
example:

**Weekly Schedule**

Monday – Upper  
Tuesday – Lower  
Wednesday – Off  
Thursday – Upper  
Friday – Lower  
Saturday & Sunday – Off  

On Upper days, you will work out all the major muscle groups like back, chest,
biceps, triceps, traps, and[ abs](https://www.hevyapp.com/lower-ab-workout/)

. On the Lower workout, you will train all of the [lower body’s major
muscles](https://www.hevyapp.com/leg-workouts-and-lower-body-exercises/) –
glutes, hamstrings, quads, and calves.

People tend to have multiple variations of an Upper or a Lower routine, so
that they can perform different exercises and workout muscle groups in
different intensities depending on the workout.

## **4 Day Upper/Lower Workout Overview**

Let’s get more practical and take a more in-depth look at the gold standard of
the Upper/Lower split – training four days per week.

**Weekly Schedule**

Monday – Upper  
Tuesday – Lower  
Wednesday – Off  
Thursday – Upper  
Friday – Lower  
Saturday – Off  
Sunday – Off  

This is the classic upper/lower split most people know. It’s fantastic because
you have a consistent schedule from week to week, you get to train each muscle
group twice per week, and the frequency is not overwhelming
([7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27102172/)).

Upper-Lower-1024x585.jpg)

Here are 4 Upper/Lower workouts you can alternate in a weekly schedule.

**Upper 1**

• Barbell Bench Press – 3 sets of 6 to 10 reps  
• Barbell Bent Over Rows – 3 sets of 6 to 10 reps  
• Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press – 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps  
• Lat Pulldowns – 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps  
• Low Cable Chest Flyes – 2 sets of 12 to 15 reps  
• Dumbbell Curl – 2 sets of 12 to 15 reps  
• Overhead Dumbbell Tricep Extensions – 2 sets of 12 to 15 reps  
• Rope Cable Face Pulls – 2 sets of 15 to 25 reps

**Lower 1**

• Back Squats – 3 sets of 6 to 10 reps  
• Glute Ham Raises – 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps  
• Alternating Forward Lunges – 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps  
• Lying Hamstring Curls – 2-3 sets of 12 to 15 reps  
• Standing Smith Machine Calf Raises – 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps

**Upper 2**

• Pull Ups – 3 sets of 5 to 10 reps  
• Incline Dumbbell Bench Press – 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps  
• Standing Barbell Push Press – 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps  
• Cable Lat Pullovers – 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps  
• Bodyweight Push-ups – 2 sets of 10 to 20 reps  
• EZ-bar Bicep Curl – 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps  
• Dumbbell Tricep Kickbacks – 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps

**Lower 2**

• Leg Press – 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps  
• Romanian Deadlift – 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps  
• Unilateral Dumbbell Shrug – 3 sets of 8 to 15 reps  
• Leg Extensions – 2-3 sets of 12 to 15 reps  
• Seated Machine Calf Raises – 3-4 sets of 12 to 20 reps  
• Hanging Leg Raises – 3-4 sets of 10 to 20 reps  

This routine is fantastic for early to late intermediates, and you can use it
to make great gains for many years. What’s more, your muscles have enough time
to recover before you have to train them again, and there aren’t many
consecutive training days.

This is a relatively strict upper/lower split, with a couple of exceptions: on
your Lower 2 workout, you also do some direct ab and trap work, as adding them
to your upper days will make these workouts even longer and more fatiguing.

As far as warming up goes, you should always prepare your entire body for both
types of workouts. This will help maximize your performance and minimize the
risk of injury. A bit of light cardio, followed by some dynamic exercises
should be enough. Then, take your time to work up to your training weights on
the first exercise.

As far as rest between sets goes, you should rest for as long as you need so
that you can do your prescribed repetitions on each set
([8](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26605807/)). For example, if you do ten
reps on set one, you should get at least eight on the last. If you can’t,
you’re either training too close to failure or not resting long enough.

## **The Benefits Of The Upper/Lower Split**

While it may seem overly-simplistic, the upper/lower split offers numerous
benefits related to volume allocation and muscle growth. Let’s take a look:

### **1\. It Works With Multiple Training Frequencies**

The issue with most splits is that you’re more or less boxed in with a
particular training frequency. However, the upper/lower routine is great
because you can use it for at least four distinct training frequencies, which
we’ll look at below.

So, whether you can train twice or six times per week, you can make an
upper/lower split work for you. Say that you’re a weekend warrior and can only
train twice per week – on Saturday and Sunday. While not ideal, you can have
an upper-body workout on Saturday, and a lower-body on Sunday
([2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29967584/)).

Alternatively, you might be more interested in a high-frequency program, in
which case you could do [6 workouts per week](https://www.hevyapp.com/6-day-
split-workout-complete-guide/), three lower and three upper workouts, or try
either [German volume training](https://www.hevyapp.com/german-volume-
training/) or [PHUL workout plan](https://www.hevyapp.com/phul-power-
hypertrophy-upper-lower/). This brings us to benefit number two:

### **2\. It Works Well With The Principles of Daily Undulated Programming
(DUP)**

The “Repeated Bout Effect” states that the more we expose the body to a given
stimulus, the less it responds to it
([3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-199927030-00002)). The
more we train, the more the body adapts, and we see progressively slower
results.

For example, the first time we do a [bicep
exercise](https://www.hevyapp.com/dumbbell-biceps-workout/), it causes
significant disruption – muscle damage, and metabolic stress. Our biceps are
sore, and weak for days. But then, as we do more of this training, it causes a
smaller disruption until it no longer causes any significant growth. At some
point, we can train our biceps so hard, and we won’t experience even half the
adverse effects of training – soreness, weakness, and such.

On the one hand, that’s a good thing – after all, most people prefer not to
feel soreness and weakness from training. But, according to most experts,
finding ways to keep our training somewhat novel is important for creating a
strong growth-response. In other words, we need to experience a fair amount of
discomfort from our training to keep progressing over the months and years.

Daily undulated programming refers to the change in training variables
(intensity/volume/rep ranges/exercise selection) with the aim of keeping the
“Repeated Bout Effect” away
([4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10905302_A_Comparison_of_Linear_and_Daily_Undulating_Periodized_Programs_With_Equated_Volume_and_Intensity_for_Local_Muscular_Endurance)).
The goal is to prevent the body from fully adapting to the training stressors.
That way, we can cause larger disruptions, and, hopefully, grow more over
time.

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/10/sergio-pedemonte-rjTlwUzosHA-unsplash.jpg)

So, instead of changing these variables every so often (say, weekly, monthly,
or even less often), we change them for every workout. For example:

**Variable Exercise Selection**

Monday (Lower) – High bar back squats (3 sets of 8 reps) + calves  
Tuesday (Upper)  
Wednesday (Lower) – High bar speed squats (7 sets of 3 reps) + glutes  
Thursday (Upper)  
Friday (Lower) – Low bar back squats (5 sets of 5 reps) + hamstrings  
Saturday (Upper)  

For example, you can also incorporate block programming elements and
prioritize one movement (the squat, in our above example) for four to six
weeks. Then start emphasizing another – for example, the bench press while
working to maintain your strength on the squat.

### **3\. It Allows You to Better Focus On Individual Muscle Groups**

Setting up an effective training split can be challenging precisely because of
the overlap issue. Knowing how to sequence workouts can be challenging, and if
we don’t do it right, we can unknowingly hinder our performance.

For example, if you train your chest on Monday and then go for a tricep or
shoulder workout on Tuesday, you won’t perform as best as you usually could.
The reason is, your shoulders and triceps are reasonably involved in chest
training and also need time to recover
([5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20512064/),[
6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6568408/)).

The great thing about the upper/lower split is that you train the overlapping
muscles on the same day and then give them enough time to recover before
training them again.

### **Alternative Scheduling options for Upper/Lower Workout Split**

Everyone is going to have a different schedule and priority in their training.
The great thing about the Upper Lower training plan is it allows you for
plenty of flexibility in how you organize your training schedule. Below, we’ve
added two other ways in which you can schedule your upper/lower workout split.

### **3 Day Upper/Lower Split**

**Week 1**| **Week 2**  
---|---  
Monday – Upper  
Tuesday – Of  
Wednesday – Lower  
Thursday – Off  
Friday – Upper  
Saturday – Off  
Sunday – Off| Monday – Lower  
Tuesday – Off  
Wednesday – Upper  
Thursday – Off  
Friday – Lower  
Saturday – Off  
Sunday – Off  
  
As you can see, this arrangement spans across two weeks. With it, you train
your upper body twice in week one, and then your lower body twice in week two.

The great thing about it is, you have excellent scheduling flexibility. The
bad thing is, it might not be enough training volume to cause optimal muscle
growth or strength gain.

### **5 Day Upper/Lower Split**

**Week 1**| **Week 2**| **Week 3**| **Week 4**  
---|---|---|---  
Monday – Upper  
Tuesday – Lower  
Wednesday – Off  
Thursday – Upper  
Friday – Lower  
Saturday – Off  
Sunday – Upper| Monday – Lower  
Tuesday – Off  
Wednesday – Upper  
Thursday – Lower  
Friday – Off  
Saturday – Upper  
Sunday – Lower| Monday – Off  
Tuesday – Upper  
Wednesday – Lower  
Thursday – Upper  
Friday – Off  
Saturday – Lower  
Sunday – Upper| Monday – Lower  
Tuesday – Off  
Wednesday – Upper  
Thursday – Lower  
Friday – Off  
Saturday – Upper  
Sunday – Lower  
  
Technically, a 5-day split can work. The problem is that scheduling it is
difficult, and your workout days will fluctuate from week to week. Plus, you
will also have some instances where you train three consecutive days in a row.

### **The Bottom Line On Training Frequency**

As a whole, the 4 day Upper Lower split seems to work best, as it offers a
consistent and (relatively) flexible schedule, and plenty of volume. Higher
frequencies can work, but you shouldn’t worry about them unless you’re quite
advanced, and have excellent scheduling flexibility.

However, if you’re short one time, working out twice a week will always be
better than not working out at all. You could achieve such a [workout
plan](https://www.hevyapp.com/workout-plans-for-every-fitness-level/) with a 2
day Upper/Lower plan, or a [5×5 A & B
workout](https://www.hevyapp.com/5x5-workout/) for example.

## **Who Is The Upper/Lower Split For?**

As you’ve probably gathered by now, the upper/lower split is incredibly
flexible and can be quite beneficial for people with all sorts of schedules
and fitness abilities.

While many people like to label different programs for beginners or advanced,
with a bit of tweaking, the upper/lower can work for almost everyone. For
example, take the 3 day upper/lower split: it offers a decent training
frequency, and you can add a fair amount of training volume. Early
intermediates can use it quite well for a long time.

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/09/physiqueGym.jpg)

If you’re just getting started with working out, the [2-day split
](https://www.hevyapp.com/2-day-split-workout/)can work fantastic. Have an
upper workout on Monday and a lower workout on Thursday, and call it a week.
It will be enough to cause growth, but it won’t be too much to feel
overwhelmed or overtrained.

If you’re like most people and have the typical recoverability and scheduling
flexibility, then the 4-day version will probably work best. You have a
consistent schedule, you get to train your muscles twice per week, and there
are plenty of opportunities to add training volume.

## **Rest Days During the Upper/Lower Split**

The upper/lower split’s beauty is that it offers numerous scheduling options,
and you can arrange your recovery days however you wish. For example, if you
follow the typical 3 day upper lower split, you can schedule your recovery
days in several ways. For example:

**Week 1**  
Monday – Off  
Tuesday – Upper  
Wednesday – Off  
Thursday – Off  
Friday – Lower  
Saturday – Off  
Sunday – Upper| **Week 2**  
Monday – Off  
Tuesday – Off  
Wednesday – Lower  
Thursday – Upper  
Friday – Off  
Saturday – Lower  
Sunday – Off  
---|---  
  
This is one example where you don’t train on Mondays if you don’t want to. You
can also arrange your workouts to have two recovery days in a row if you need
to. For example, if you have a hard day at work on Monday and you’ve trained
the previous day, you can take two days off and hit the gym on Wednesday.

The 4-day split is also flexible, and you can make it fit you better. For
example, if the workweek tends to be incredibly challenging, you can have two
light workouts on, say, Tuesday and Thursday, and then go in on Saturday and
Sunday for two high-volume workouts.

**Weekly Workout Intensity & Rest**

Monday – Off  
Tuesday – Upper (light)  
Wednesday – Off  
Thursday – Lower (light)  
Friday – Off  
Saturday – (high volume)  
Sunday – Lower (high volume)  

Most importantly, you should look at your schedule, recognize potential
stressors (e.g., Monday is your most challenging workday of the week), and
design your training around it.

## **What Are The Pros And Cons Of The Upper/Lower?**

Like most things, the upper/lower split has its fair share of positives and
negatives. Let’s take a look at the most apparent ones:

### Pros

  * It offers a superior training frequency for most lifters. An ever-growing body of literature suggests that training our muscles twice per week might be more beneficial for long-term improvements ([7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27102172/)). With the typical 4-day upper lower split, you can do that quite well, and you don’t have to maintain an incredibly high training frequency.
  * It allows us to improve and maintain movement proficiency much better because we get to perform the different exercises more often throughout the week. For some people, training a lift once per week is not enough, and their strength barely improves because they can’t solidify proper lifting form.
  * It’s great for accumulating weekly training volume without having to overexert ourselves in any given workout. For example, if you have to do 16 weekly sets for chest, doing that in two [upper body workouts](https://www.hevyapp.com/upper-body-workout-exercises/) will be much easier and more sustainable. Consider some of these [great chest exercises for women](https://www.hevyapp.com/chest-exercises-for-women/) and men alike.
  * It can work great for lifters of all levels, so long as you tweak the training variables correctly. If you’re a complete beginner, you can start with a twice-weekly frequency. Eventually, as you become advanced, you can go as high as six workouts per week.
  * It’s fantastic for preventing volume overlap as you have two distinct workouts – an upper and a lower one. Meaning, the risk of training fatigued muscles too soon is much smaller than other training splits.

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/10/lyfe-fuel-phY30gaxqS8-unsplash.jpg)

### Cons

It wouldn’t be fair to discuss the benefits and completely disregard the
upper/lower split’s potential downsides.

With that said, it’s worth noting that the upper/lower split is reasonably
balanced and works great for most people. So long as you program
intelligently, you won’t run into many drawbacks.

  * Your upper body workouts can become quite long and tedious because there are many muscle groups to account for – your [back](https://www.hevyapp.com/dumbbell-back-workout/), chest, shoulders, triceps, biceps, traps, upper/[lower abs](https://www.hevyapp.com/lower-ab-workout/), and obliques. If you do just three sets for your back, chest, shoulders, triceps, and biceps, you’ll still have to do a total of 15 working sets.
  * On the other hand, you might find that your lower body workouts tend to finish much quicker, as there are fewer muscle groups to train. Because of that, you might find a hybrid approach to be better. In other words, if you’re adamant about doing direct work for your traps, abs, obliques, and forearms, you might want to consider adding them to your lower body days.
  * You will have to make some tradeoffs in terms of priority. For example, the [bro split](https://www.hevyapp.com/bro-split-workout-program-guide/) offers us the chance to give each muscle priority within the training week. On an upper/lower split, you have to pick one muscle group to start with, and put the remaining ones on the backburner. For example, you can start with the bench press, but you won’t do your rows in a fully recovered state.
  * Typically, our workouts have a single warm-up that consists of a bit of cardio to get the blood flowing, dynamic work to loosen us up, and warm-up sets to work up to our training weights. For the most part, the upper/lower split follows the same directive. But, if you do, say, heavy rows after bench press, it’s good to include a few warm-up sets for that second exercise, which can lengthen your workouts.

## **Progression With Upper/Lower Workouts**

The upper/lower split can work with sophisticated progression schemes. But,
for the average lifter, a basic linear progression model will be more than
enough ([9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25268290/)). In one of the
previous points, we shared a few sample workouts and prescribed various
repetition ranges on each exercise.

![Dumbbell Gym
Rack](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Dumbbell
Gym Rack](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ambitious-
creative-co-rick-barrett-uwk8IS-HfJ8-unsplash.jpg)

The goal is to set rough guidelines for each exercise and start working toward
the upper range. Once you cover your repetition goals for every set, increase
the weight for the following workout.

Say, for example, that you’ve prescribed 6 to 10 reps on the bent-over row,
and you start with 115 pounds. Here is how to go about it:

Upper Workout #1 (115 pounds):  
Set 1 – 10 reps  
Set 2 – 9 reps  
Set 3 – 7 reps  
Set 4 – 6 reps| Upper Workout #2 (115 pounds):  
Set 1 – 10 reps  
Set 2 – 10 reps  
Set 3 – 8 reps  
Set 4 – 6 reps  
| Upper Workout #3 (115 pounds):  
Set 1 – 10 reps  
Set 2 – 10 reps  
Set 3 – 10 reps  
Set 4 – 8 reps  
| Upper Workout #4 (115 pounds):  
Set 1 – 10 reps  
Set 2 – 10 reps  
Set 3 – 10 reps  
Set 4 – 10 reps  
| Upper Workout #5 (125 pounds):  
Set 1 – 8 reps  
Set 2 – 7 reps  
Set 3 – 6 reps  
Set 4 – 6 reps  
  
---|---|---|---|---  
  
As you can see, at #4 once we could do 10 reps of the exercise, we add more
weight and repeat the cycle. This linear model can work for every exercise you
do, and, so long as you’re consistent, it will produce impressive results in
the long run.

Of course, it’s also essential to stay as objective as possible and ensure
that your technique remains solid week after week. If you start compromising
technique for the sake of lifting more weight, you will eventually find
yourself ego lifting and thinking that you’ve gotten stronger.

## **How Long Should I Train to See Results?**

This is one of the most common questions beginners ask, and it’s a bit
difficult to answer. How quickly you can see results depends on multiple
factors, including your training. Your genetics, consistency, effort level,
nutritional quality, sleep habits, and life stressors all play roles in the
equation.

How well (or poorly) you manage to [track](https://www.hevyapp.com/) your
progress also matters. You might be making good progress, but may not realize
it and think that you’re stuck if you track it well.
[Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/) can help you track your workouts, you can log
each set and get in-depth analytics on your progress. On the other hand, some
folks believe that they are progressing well when they aren’t. For example,
some people overeat, gain a lot of fat, and think that it’s mostly muscle –
this is the well-known dirty bulk.

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![](https://www.hevyapp.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/10/anastase-maragos-oNQ48mnAVcA-unsplash.jpg)

To say that you should expect results in a given amount of time would
disservice you. The truth is, no person can predict that. What we can do,
however, is give you rough guidelines.

According to a scale Lyle McDonald made a while
[back,](https://www.hevyapp.com/dumbbell-back-workout/) a beginner can expect
to build as much as 20 to 22 pounds of muscle mass within the first year of
training. In year two, that growth rate is cut in half – around 10-11 pounds
in twelve months. After that, muscle growth slows down even more, and we can
typically expect to build no more than five pounds of muscle in a year of
training.

So, to answer the question of, “How long should I train to see results?” it’s
difficult to say. If you’re a beginner and dedicate yourself to a solid split
and nutritional plan, you should see progress within weeks
([10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6710320/)). If you’re more
advanced, then it will take you longer to see positive results. We’ve actually
done [an analysis](https://www.hevyapp.com/stronger-with-hevy/) on Hevy users
who track their workouts, turns out, they’ve gotten stronger!

## Upper Lower – Training Plan Comparisons

### **Upper/Lower vs. 3-Day Full Body Split**

The 3-day split (also known as a full-body split) is excellent for beginners
and early intermediates because it allows them to train each muscle three
times per week. What’s more, the 3-day split allows new lifters to learn
proper training form quicker because it exposes them to the different
exercises more often.

Virtually all good beginner training programs revolve around full-body
training concepts because it offers incredible versatility, works great with
linear progression models, and the individual workouts aren’t that high in
volume.

The upper/lower split, on the other hand, is typically used for a 4-day
program and is better suited for intermediate lifters. Advanced lifters can
also use the upper/lower split, and they can train five or six times per week
for the sake of adding more volume.

Both splits offer their unique advantages and disadvantages. Which one you
choose to go with will mostly depend on your current situation, future goals,
and preferences.If you’re a beginner who is just getting started, then a 3-day
full body split or a [3 day classic bodybuilder
split](https://www.hevyapp.com/3-day-split-workout-complete-guide/) will
probably be better. But, if you’re past that stage and you’ve mostly exhausted
your newbie gains, then the upper/lower split will be a better choice.

### **Upper/Lower vs.[Push/Pull/Legs](https://www.hevyapp.com/push-pull-legs-
ultimate-guide/)**

The [push pull legs](https://www.hevyapp.com/push-pull-legs-ultimate-guide/)
is another popular split used by many, and it’s more similar to the
upper/lower than people imagine.

In essence, the [push/pull/legs](https://www.hevyapp.com/push-pull-legs-
ultimate-guide/) and upper/lower splits are identical. The primary difference
is the fact that you combine your push and pull workouts into one upper
session. This allows you to train all of your upper body muscles in a single
workout instead of two.

Both splits offer their unique advantages and disadvantages. For example, the
upper/lower split allows you to schedule your weekly training with a 4-day
frequency easily. You have a fair amount of flexibility, you can easily
establish a consistent schedule, and you get to train all of your muscles
twice per week.

The primary downside of the upper/lower split is the programming of your
workouts. Most people find that their upper workouts have to be longer than
their lower training because there are more muscle groups to account for.

On the other hand, the [push/pull/legs](https://www.hevyapp.com/push-pull-
legs-ultimate-guide/) split allows for easier programming of the individual
workouts because you have fewer muscles to account for in each workout. In
essence, you’re splitting your upper training into two workouts. The [push
pull legs](https://www.hevyapp.com/push-pull-legs-ultimate-guide/)‘ primary
downside is that scheduling your weekly training can be a bit more tricky.

Both splits are reliable, and you might want to try them out to see which one
you prefer.

### **Upper/Lower vs. Bro Split**

The [bro split](https://www.hevyapp.com/bro-split-workout-program-guide/) has
been around for a long time, and many people deem it the most optimal way to
organize our weekly training.

To a degree, the [bro split](https://www.hevyapp.com/bro-split-workout-
program-guide/) can be incredibly fun and productive. For example, with a bro
split, you focus on individual muscle groups and attack them with plenty of
exercises and volume. Programming your workouts and weekly schedule is easy
because the goal is simple: Have dedicated workouts for the major muscle
groups in your body.

[Bro splits](https://www.hevyapp.com/bro-split-workout-program-guide/) also
tend to be more engaging for some people because they fatigue their muscles a
lot, and that can give them a sense of progression; of more effective training
if you will.

The primary downside of the [bro split](https://www.hevyapp.com/bro-split-
workout-program-guide/) is the low training frequency. According to many
people today, training our muscles only once per week is not enough to cause
optimal muscle growth ([11](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8563679/)).
Because of that, the same folks typically recommend an upper/lower or PPL
split because it allows for a higher training frequency.

The [bro split](https://www.hevyapp.com/bro-split-workout-program-guide/) also
requires a higher training frequency – ideally, training five to six days per
week, which might not be sustainable for many people.

The upper/lower split is not entirely different, but you get to bundle your
shoulder, arm, chest, and [back ](https://www.hevyapp.com/dumbbell-back-
workout/)training into one, instead of having to dedicate separate workouts
for each.

## **Conclusion**

So, what’s the bottom line on the upper/lower split?

Well, as a tried-and-true method of organizing our weekly training, the
upper/lower split is a fantastic option for intermediate lifters who want to
optimize their muscle growth and strength gains. Splitting your training into
upper and lower body is a perfectly viable way to accumulate volume and
progress well.  

The one drawback to upper/lower training, as discussed above, is the fact that
your upper sessions tend to be longer because you have more muscle groups to
train. On the other hand, lower body sessions are typically shorter. Of
course, with a bit of thought, you can make it work incredibly well. For
example, you can take the hybrid approach and include your direct ab, trap,
and forearm training into your lower body workouts.

If you’re busier and can’t make it to the gym more than four times per week,
the upper/lower split might be your best bet. It allows you to train no more
than four times per week, do enough volume, and still train all of your
muscles twice per week.

Combined with a solid nutritional plan, plenty of sleep, consistency, and
effort, the upper/lower split can help you achieve fantastic results in mere
months ([10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6710320/),[

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

Here are the seven most frequently asked questions about the upper/lower
split:

**1) What is an upper/lower split?  
**

The upper/lower split is a way of organizing your weekly training by splitting
your workouts into distinct upper and lower sessions. For example, you train
all of the major muscle groups in the upper body on an upper day – back,
chest, biceps, triceps, traps, and abs. On a lower day, you train all of the
lower body’s major muscles – glutes, hamstrings, quads, and calves.  
  
The most common weekly schedule is the 4-day program – two upper and two lower
workouts.  

**2) When should I do cardio when doing an upper/lower split?  
**

If your schedule allows, you should do cardio on your rest days. If that’s not
possible, you can do cardio at least six hours before or after training. This
helps minimize the interference effect
([14](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24728927/)).  
  
Another alternative is to do cardio after doing your resistance training.

**3) How many exercises per muscle group in an upper/lower split?  
**

This largely depends on your volume goals for each workout and your weekly
training schedule. For example, if you follow the typical 4-day split, you can
do two exercises for the chest, back, quads, hamstrings, and shoulders, and
one for your biceps, triceps, abs, glutes, and calves.  
  
As a whole, doing two to three exercises for your larger muscle groups and one
to two for the smaller ones every week is a good rule.

**4) Why is the upper/lower split superior?  
**

The upper/lower split is superior to other ways of organizing our training
mostly because:  
  
– It’s relatively simple to set up  
– It offers a consistent training schedule  
– You get to train your muscle groups twice per week  
– Accumulating weekly volume is easy

**5) How long should my workouts be?  
**

As long as you need to do all of your exercises, sets, reps, and warm-up. For
the average intermediate lifter, this should be somewhere between 50 and 75
minutes.

**6) Is an upper/lower split a good routine for beginners?  
**

It can work. But, beginners will most likely benefit more from full-body
training two to three days per week. This is because the full-body split
allows them to learn different movements more quickly, and it’s an excellent
way to accumulate enough volume for optimal hypertrophy and strength.

**7) Which workout should I do first in the week, upper or lower?  
**

It doesn’t matter much, and you can go either way. It should mostly be based
on your schedule, as your upper workouts will tend to be a bit longer than
your lower ones. For example, if you typically have less free time to train on
Monday, you can do your lower workout and hit your upper body on Tuesday.
